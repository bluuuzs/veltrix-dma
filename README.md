### Notes & Changes

**Notes:**

You can preview what the webmenu will look like (with way more features once i get time to add them) here: [https://veltrixsolutions.xyz/preview](https://veltrixsolutions.xyz/preview)
You **cannot** launch Veltrix.exe without using the Loader, it will give you an error. The loader will check for updates and automatically install them if there are any.
The DLL's and Veltrix.exe will be hidden if you dont have Show Hidden Files enabled in explorer to keep it clean
With the Loader you wont have to download it again when an update releases unless we update the loader, all you do is run the Loader and it'll install/update and then launch.
